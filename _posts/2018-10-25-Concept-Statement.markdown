 The team is working with the Defenders of Wildlife group to create a redesign of their secondary website that targets researchers and policy makers. The site is intended as a reference when gathering data and insights about various endangered species, and policies proposed and enacted to protect them. Currently, users are confused by the layout and content of the site, and the goal of the redesign is to provide a hands-on way to view and interact with data through maps and web applications to extract meaningful insights about conservation of various species and policies surrounding the environmental conservancy field. This redesign carries significance because it will provide a more accessible way to access hard evidence of environmental issues, and allows understanding of these problems through interaction with data.
