### Mental Model

The current system is a technical website of the Center for Conservation and Innovation, and its organization can be seen below, alongside the new proposed organization. The biggest struggle users faced in the interviews were understanding what this site was, and where to find things. They scrolled for noticeably lengthy times, and kept on scrolling up, then down, then up again - with a look of confusion on their face. The global navigation didn’t help much either - categories weren’t descriptive, and content that seemed to belong to one category, such as maps, could be found under Apps. There was no indication where a user was on the page in relation to how much content they had seen and how much they would see if they kept scrolling. It seemed like an overwhelming amount of information that led to inaction. Rarely did a user click on any content on the actual page (excluding the navigation), they just kept scrolling. 

The new system hopes to eliminate this issue through clearer organization, clear “buckets” of information and resources, and allow a user to seamlessly navigate while being aware of their location on the site at any time. It also aims to eliminate the quantity of clicks needed to get anywhere, and the lengthy scrolling time. With a clearer layout of information, users will be able to find what they need quickly and efficiently, and be satisfied with the experience, thus being more likely to return.

### Mapping From Designers To Users

The conceptual design acts as a mapping from our team of designers to the user. Users visiting this site will be able to figure out how the site works and how it is organized through improved navigation, clearer categorization of content, and the “dodo bird” feature. This will aid in building the users mental model of the website and what information they might find in the various locations. Going deeper, the tutorials would help with familiarizing the user in how they might hope to interact with a map or an app. Of course, it’s always best to make technology that works for the user, not make the user work to use the technology, but it’s costly to rebuild the dozens of web apps already on the site. The next best solution is to provide a simple and straightforward tutorial as an explanation for the user to improve discoverability and usability of the website’s main purpose. Although we have not yet started constructing mock ups, we will likely consider implementing very common design standards that can be seen throughout most commonly used sites to help the user get acquainted with the site as fast as possible upon landing.

### Storyboard

Our storyboard aims to show a scenario involving one of the personas we previously created. In this scenario, a high school students needs graphical content for a project presentation. Using the ‘Maps’ of the Center for Conservation Innovation site, the student can save a screenshot of the endangered species of his/her locality which then can be used on a poster.
