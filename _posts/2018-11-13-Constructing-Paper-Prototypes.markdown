Tasks and Features
A user must be able to find content they are searching for. Features to address this user task are the search bar, the Dodo bot, and a new and improved layout. The search bar is now in a more noticeable location, and uses suggestions to help a user seek information. The Dodo bot is a personalized help assistant for finding information and doing research. It is a useful feature for a new user who isnâ€™t as familiar with the site or with doing research as a whole. It streamlines the process of searching for relevant information. The new layout is more organized and groups items and resources into intuitive categories, and provides a familiar structure across the site. 

A user must be able to easily navigate the site. A feature to address this user task is an improved layout. First, the global navigation will be simplified and expanded. Second, the structure of the site is altered to ensure intuitive groups. For instance, right now a user can find 3 map resources under maps, and then 2 more map resources under apps, which was perceived as confusing. There are many more examples of misclassification across the site, and hence a more structured layout that can be seen in detail was introduced in Project 4.2. Third, the layout of pages will be simplified and standardized to help users differentiate between contents. Something that came up across many interviews was a confusion of where a resource started and ended, as well as complaints that a user could only see approximately one resource on a screen when scrolling and looking for the correct information. We aim to solve this as exemplified in the first prototype picture below. The title will stand out and be denoted by a link, a brief description in a lighter shade and smaller font will be underneath, and an image of the resource will be on the right. This will be standard across Apps, Maps and Research. 

We chose these features because they solved the main problems users were experiencing when trying to fulfill their information seeking need when conducting research. People were confused by the site, mainly because of navigation, layout and presentation of information.
