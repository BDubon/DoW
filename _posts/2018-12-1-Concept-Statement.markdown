The team is working with the Defenders of Wildlife group to redesign their secondary website. The site is intended as a reference for researchers and policy makers to extract meaningful insights about policies surrounding environmental conservation. Currently, target users are confused by the layout and content of the site. The goal of the redesign is to give users a more intuitive experience to find the information they need. This will provide a more streamlined way to access hard evidence of environmental issues, and allow greater understanding of these problems through interaction with data and published research. 


### Summary

- The website we are working on will provide a hands-on way to view and interact with data through maps and web applications to extract meaningful insights about conservation of various species and policies surrounding the environmental conservancy field. 
- We are working for the Defenders of Wildlife group to create a re-design of their secondary website that targets researchers and policy makers.
- The website is intended to act as a data resource that researchers and policy makers can reference when gathering data and insights about various endangered species, and policies that have been enacted or proposed to protect them.
- This redesign carries significance to both our client and intended user group because it provides a more accessible way to obtain hard evidence on environmental issues, and allows understanding of these problems through interaction with data.
