The user experience (UX) lifecycle process is comprised of 4 distinct parts that tend to be iterative until the desired goal is met. As part of our project, we had to first identify the problem that our client is facing so we can provide a solution that fits their needs. In the UX lifecycle process, this phase would fall into the "Analyze" stage.

> “The links should take me straight to the content.” 

As part of the analysis, we organized a set of questions to ask potential users of the site to try to identify common issues that could help us understand how users feel and react to the website's content. We tried to target people who would be direct website users but due to time limitations, we decided to narrow our potential interviewees to three categories: voters, people who donate to environmental causes, and researchers using the data to persuade policymakers. Our most accessible subjects were voters. Most of these people, however, were unfamiliar with the site and found it rather confusing to navigate. Some users thought it was odd that one would have to click multiple times to display the requested content.

## Methodology

Once we decided on the questions, we proceded to conduct our interviews. We provided the users with a laptop to navigate the site and asked the questions that we had prepared while recording the interview for further analysis. A major part of this process was observing how the subjects interacted with the site. We tasked the users with specific activies to record their behavior. Due to their lack of knowledge on the topic and the site's navigation difficulties, multiple users failed to complete the tasks and required assiatance from us to continue the interview. It's important to us to be able to evaluate any design proposals that may arise from this process, so we asked the users if they would be willing to participate in the future if we needed their opinion.
