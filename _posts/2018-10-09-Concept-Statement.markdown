Our client, Defenders of Wildlife, uses the Center for Conservation Innovation (CCI) as a hub to share data relating the Endangered Species Act (ESA) with researchers and policy makers. Our goal is to improve the site's navigation to provide a better experience finding the desired content by the users.

The website we are working on will provide a hands-on way to view and interact with data through maps and web applications to extract meaningful insights about conservation of various species and policies surrounding the environmental conservancy field. 
We are working for the Defenders of Wildlife group to create a re-design of their secondary website that targets researchers and policy makers.
The website is intended to act as a data resource that researchers and policy makers can reference when gathering data and insights about various endangered species, and policies that have been enacted or proposed to protect them.
This redesign carries significance to both our client and intended user group because it provides a more accessible way to obtain hard evidence on environmental issues, and allows understanding of these problems through interaction with data.
