The Center for Conservation Innovation's website (cci.dev.org) serves as a hub for researchers looking for data and studies relating to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The organization responsible for managin the site is Defenders of Wildlife. The organizations has its own website (defenders.org) but there isn't any obvious connections between the two. However, our focus is on CCI's site. We aim to improve the navigation for people to find their content faster by creating a more intuitive interface. The current look of the site seems outdated and, based on our context inquiry, users have trouble navigating the menus. If we are able to present more explicit menu options and reduce the number of clicks a user takes, we believe that the experience would be improved greatly.

The current site offers a video tutorial on how to navigate it but it's not being introduced properly to the users. We believe that having a proper guide on how to use the site could reduce many of the most common complaints expressed in the interviews we conducted. 


## Summary

- The website we are working on will provide a hands-on way to view and interact with data through maps and web applications to extract meaningful insights about conservation of various species and policies surrounding the environmental conservancy field. 
- We are working for the Defenders of Wildlife group to create a re-design of their secondary website that targets researchers and policy makers.
- The website is intended to act as a data resource that researchers and policy makers can reference when gathering data and insights about various endangered species, and policies that have been enacted or proposed to protect them.
- This redesign carries significance to both our client and intended user group because it provides a more accessible way to obtain hard evidence on environmental issues, and allows understanding of these problems through interaction with data.
