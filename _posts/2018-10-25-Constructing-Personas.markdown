### Choosing Personas

When considering what personas to include, we wanted them to span the range of possible users, while still staying specific enough to yield insights and evoke empathy and understanding. We thought about the three possible types of users the website would attract, and gave each of them a personality that would likely match their background. We tried to put ourselves into their shoes and think about what goals they might be trying to accomplish, what their needs were, and any constraints they might face. One of the things we considered were also disabilities, particularly those that our target users could potentially have. It occurred to us that some common impediments people may face when using the site could be dyslexia, color blindness, and a language barrier.

The persona above was our attempt to create a user that would visit the website sporadically. By including this persona, we can broaden our perspective on the multiple ways users will interact with the website. Also, being a native speaker of another language helps us keep in mind the terminology that we should use to facilitate accessibility throughout the site's pages. However, the main idea behind 'Jane Doe' was to maintain a sense of simplicity in our design. The website we're working on should be full of content that can be easily accessed by scientists as well as a high school student.
