## Choosing Personas

When considering what personas to include, we wanted them to span the range of possible users, while still staying specific enough to yield insights and evoke empathy and understanding. We thought about the three possible types of users the website would attract, and gave each of them a personality that would likely match their background. We tried to put ourselves into their shoes and think about what goals they might be trying to accomplish, what their needs were, and any constraints they might face. One of the things we considered were also disabilities, particularly those that our target users could potentially have. It occurred to us that some common impediments people may face when using the site could be dyslexia, color blindness, and a language barrier.
