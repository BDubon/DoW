### Ideation Process

Our ideation process started during an in-class assignment, when we first shared “bad ideas” surrounding this project. It was a great way to help ease the tension and let all of us ideate creatively without the fear of judgement. The easiest “bad ideas” to throw out were either things that were similar to the current issues observed with the site, or general “bad practices” for the web. After the bad ideas, we moved on to potential improvements. Having the context from talking to potential users, constructing the WAAD, and doing previous project assignments really helped us generate potential improvements. 

When talking about good ideas, we first started off with wild ideas (like a helpful but extinct Dodo bird) to remind the user that this research matters and species really do go extinct if nothing is done, while also helping them navigate the site. We then narrowed down to easily implementable changes that wouldn’t require much groundwork from the DoW team, and although these small fixes were less impressive, they would be a good tradeoff with how little work they required and how much benefit they would hold for the user. We talked about how one change, something such as “simplifying site structure”, would help all three different types of users, not just one. We then dug even deeper into the use cases for Maps and Apps between the three different personas we created, and how each of them may interact with the Maps and Apps or what they would value or need. This helped us come up with more clear and tangible ideas that were highly specific and very implementable for the DoW team.


#### Good Ideas
- Darwin the helpful dodo bird (Inspired by Clippy from Word)
- Simplifying the visualizations
- Adding more context to each page
- Accessible universal tabs  
- Tutorial for how to use the visualizations
- User profiles for saving the contents of “favorites” so users can do their research on multiple devices

#### Top Ideas
- Simplifying visualizations
  - Tutorials for use
  - Standardizing visualizations
  - Making visualizations accessible to users with varying needs
  - Having a bot assistant ready to help at any point
- Simplifying site structure
  - Making the site’s organization clear from the very first moment a user lands on the site
- User profiles
  - Help store research, let someone pick up where they left off

### Sketching Process

Seeing how many of our interview participants commented on the site’s navigation, we decided to focus our sketches on ways to improve the way people navigate through the website to find content and how we can assist them through design or directly provide instructions on certain features. the following sketch show the process of creating a new user account that would allow people to save their most used applications.

Image 1. Tutorial that will help the user discover different app features that would have been otherwise unknown to them. Because of the Websites complexity it would be extremely helpful to be walked through the websites functionalities by some type of tutorial. The website would need people to register, that way they can track new users and help them get on top of that learning curve.
