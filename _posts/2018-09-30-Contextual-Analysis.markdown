After completing our contextual inquiry, we proceed to make sense of all the data we collected. As part of our contextual analysis, we developed a flow model and a Work Activity Affinity Diagram (WAAD).

------------------------------------------------

# Flow Model
To begin designing our flow model, we must begin by identifying work roles. The purpose of the flow model is help us have a visual representation of the transactions between users and the Center for Conservation Innovation's (CCI) website. 

### Work Roles
Major Work Role: End User browsing or searching the site to get information.
### Subroles:
- Decision Makers/Policy Analysts, who may use the site’s resources (Maps, Apps, and Research articles) to gather information about proposing certain legislation.
- Environmental Activists, who may use the site’s resources to gather statistics to back their cause
Researchers, including students in college and university, who are using the site’s resources to gather statistics, information, or insights about conservation topics.
- General User/Voter, who may be curious to see exactly what kind of research his/her donations are funding.
### Machine Roles
- Database, stores all of the information, content and data shown on the site.
- CCI Website, an interface that the end user can interact with and fulfill their information need, as well as an organized collection of resources available to the end user.
- Web Apps, an interface that the end user can interact with and fulfill their information need
Defenders.org, the actual website that the Defenders organization uses to sway people and policymakers to support their cause.

# Work Activity Affinity Diagram 
We started by going through our observation notes, and separating each note by observation and
interview. After that iteration we started forming categories made of different notes. The categories we
formed were initially very specific, then we made an upper level category to generalize the sub categories.
The ones we went with were Purpose of the Site, Discoverability of Features, Navigation, Maps and
Apps. The sub categories we split into: Map Functionality, App Functionality, General, Search, Speed of
Navigation, Unintuitive Interface.
